our jsps should be all the smart parts AND the different possibilities of wholes we can make with them

so basically, take this example

we are on the blogpostDetailPage of a random article
> author of said blog post gets extra rights shown in the central area of body of the article page
( nothing changes for sidebar - sidebar gebruiker, logged in user and author user is zelfde!)
( the version of the header we use is : logged in user header )

> so does logged in user, but less than author

hence we have bodyAuthor and bodyLoggedUser jsps that we can include in the blogpostDetailPage
we would obiously need one blogpostDetailPage for each combo
so:
blogpostDetailPage
